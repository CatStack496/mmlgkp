Mass mp3 link getter for khinsider playlist

(I totally do not use this site nope definately not, this is just a project to practice a little JS, ya know)

This javascript script will allow you to fetch all links to the mp3 files of each song on a playlist page on KHinsider.
on fetching the links, it will attempt to append a long list of them, seperated by newlines, to your clipboard,
and will also output the same output to console in one big console.log so you can copy them from there if the clipboard doesnt work

its up to you what to do with those links after that. 
one idea would to use an extension like Simple Mass Downloader, which is both on Firefox and Chrome, and paste all the links from your clipboard to download them

I dont condone using this site to illegally download music, so whatever you do with the site and this tool is at your own risk.

A bookmarklet version is included in bookmarklet.txt
The standalone script is in mmlgkp.js
